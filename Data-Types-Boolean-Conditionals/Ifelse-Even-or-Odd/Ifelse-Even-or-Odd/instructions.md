# Instructions
1. Write a program in `main.py` that reads a single number from the user.
2. If the number is odd, the program should print `Odd`.
3. If the number is even, the program should print `Even`.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
5
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
Odd
```

### Example 2
#### Example Input #2
```plaintext
6
```
#### Example Output #2
```plaintext
Even
```

## Hint
1. Use the `input()` function to read a number from the user, and convert it to an integer.
2. To determine whether a number is odd or even, you can use the modulus operator `%`. A number is even if itâ€™s divisible by 2 (`number % 2 == 0`), and it's odd if it's not divisible by 2 (`number % 2 != 0`).

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- Run your program to verify that it correctly identifies odd and even numbers based on user input.

- After confirming the correctness of your code, proceed to submit it.

### Test Results
- A correct solution will pass all the test cases and you will see the following screen.

- If any test cases fail, review the `Results` section to understand why and correct your code accordingly.

## Final Note
- Ensure your program accurately determines whether a user-inputted number is odd or even, and submit once you have verified the correctness of your implementation.
