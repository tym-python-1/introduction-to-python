# Instructions
1. In your `main.py` file, write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user.
2. The program should then multiply the two numbers and print out the result.

## Example
### Example Input
```plaintext
5
3
```
### Example Output
```plaintext
15
```

## Hint
1. Use the `input` function to take two number inputs from the user.
2. Convert the user input to `int` or `float` as the `input` function returns a string.
3. Perform multiplication operation on the two numbers.
4. Use the `print` function to output the result to the console.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the input.

### Test Results
- If your code passes all the tests, you will see the following screen.

- If any test case fails, analyze the `Results` section to identify the error and refine your code.

## Final Note
- Before submitting, make sure that your program correctly takes the user's numerical inputs and prints the result of the multiplication.
