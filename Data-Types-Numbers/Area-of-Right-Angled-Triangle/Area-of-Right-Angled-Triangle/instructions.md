# Instructions
1. Write a program in `main.py` that reads the length of the base and the height of a right-angled triangle from the user input, each on a separate line, and then calculates and prints the area of the triangle.
2. The area should be printed as a float.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
3
5
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
7.5
```

### Example 2
#### Example Input #2
```plaintext
5
10
```
#### Example Output #2
```plaintext
25.0
```

## Hint
1. To read input, use the `input()` function and convert it to a float to perform the calculations.
2. Remember, the area of a right-angled triangle is given by `(1/2) * base * height`.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- After writing your program, run it to check if it calculates the area correctly for the given inputs.
