# Instructions
1. In your `main.py` file, write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user.
2. The program should then divide the first number by the second number and print out the result.

## Example
### Example Input
```plaintext
10
5
```
### Example Output
```plaintext
2.0
```

## Hint
1. Use the `input` function to take two number inputs from the user.
2. Convert the user input to `int` or `float` as the `input` function returns a string.
3. Perform division operation on the two numbers.
4. Use the `print` function to output the result to the console.
5. The output will be in `float` data type

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the input.

- If the output is correct, and there are no errors, proceed to submit it.

### Test Results
- If your code passes all the tests, you will see the following screen.

- If any test case fails, analyze the `Results` section to identify the error and refine your code.

## Final Note
- Before submitting, make sure that your program correctly takes the user's numerical inputs and prints the result of the division, handling any possible edge cases.
