# Instructions
1. Write a program in `main.py` that reads three numbers, each on a separate line, and prints their sum.
2. The program should take the numbers as input and should print the sum as output.

## Example Input and Output

### Example 1
#### Example Input #1
```plaintext
2
3
6
```
#### Example Output #1
```plaintext
11
```

## Hint
1. Make use of the `input()` function to read input and `print()` function to print the output.
2. You may need to convert the input received from the `input()` function to an integer before performing the addition, as `input()` returns a string by default.
