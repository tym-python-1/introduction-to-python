# Turtle Catch Game

Develop a game using Turtle graphics where the player navigates a turtle to catch a target object. When the turtle touches the target object, the turtle should flash green, and the target should respawn at a new position.

# Instructions
1. **Import Libraries**

2. **Setup Turtle Screen**

3. **Create Player turtle and Goal Target**

4. **Set up movement functions (`move_up`, `move_down`, `move_right` and `move_left`)**

5. **Connect arrow keys to movement function (Keybind)**

6. **Code for main game loop & Collision Detection**

## Hint
- Use `turtle.goto(x, y)` to position the turtle and the target at specific coordinates.

## Test Your Game
- Interactively test your game by using the arrow keys to move the turtle and try to catch the target.

- If the turtle changes its color to green and the target respawns when they collide, then your game is functioning correctly.

- Once you confirm that your game is running correctly, feel free to add more features like scorekeeping, multiple levels, or additional challenges to enhance the gameplay experience.
