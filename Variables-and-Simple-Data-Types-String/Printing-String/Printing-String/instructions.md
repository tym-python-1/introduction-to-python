# Instructions
1. Write a program in `main.py` that prints the following sentences, each on a separate line:
   - `Hello world!`
   - `This is my first simple output program.`
   - `print ('This is what I should be printing')`
   
2. The output in your program should match the example output provided exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise, the tests won't pass.

3. Your code should be written in the provided template in `main.py`, particularly within the designated area.

## Example Output
```plaintext
Hello world! 
This is my first simple output program.
print ('This is what I should be printing')
```

## Testing Your Code

- In case of any failed test cases, refer to `Results` to understand the reasons behind the failure.

- Be mindful that passing all test cases does not always equate to a fully correct implementation.
- Once you are confident about the accuracy of your code, proceed to submit it by pressing the submit button on the top right-hand corner.
