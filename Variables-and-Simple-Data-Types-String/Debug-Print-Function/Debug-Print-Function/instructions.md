# Instructions
1. Observe the erroneous code in the code editor. Your task is to rectify all the errors and ensure the code runs without any issues.
2. Make certain that the output of your corrected program matches the example output provided exactly, character for character. Failing to do so will lead to test failures.

## Warning
- The output in your program should match the example output shown exactly, including spaces and symbols.

## Hint
- To print double quotation marks, enclose the string within single quotation marks, and vice versa.
  ```python
  print('This is how you print a string with double quotation mark "hello"')
  ```
- Use an escape character `\` before special characters like " or ' to print them.
  ```python
  print("I\"m here!")
  ```

## Example Output
When run, your corrected program should print:
```plaintext
Lesson 1 - Output String
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
How do I print "double quotes" or 'single quotes'?
```

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- Check your code by running it. If it meets the expectations and there are no errors, proceed to submit it.
